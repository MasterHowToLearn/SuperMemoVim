![logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MasterHowToLearn/SuperMemoVim/master/images/supermemovim.png "logo")

Vim emulator customized for SuperMemo, the best learning software in the world. This is my implementation with many custom scripts for SuperMemo. For demo and accompaning article please see [SuperMemoVim: Learning By Editing at the Speed of Thought](https://www.masterhowtolearn.com/2020-05-05-supermemovim-learning-by-editing-at-the-speed-of-thought/).

This is a fork from [vim_ahk](https://github.com/rcmdnk/vim_ahk/releases). All credits go to the original developer. For details about what it could do before my SuperMemo layer is added, please visit the [original repo](https://github.com/rcmdnk/vim_ahk/).
